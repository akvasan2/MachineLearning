# Deep neural network fit to a dataset of textual descriptors of different neural network architectures

Each architecture was trained on the Cifar-10 dataset and represent error for training different models for image detection. Each model has: >200 features and two sets of labels.

The deep neural network consists of : 2 hidden layers, a sigmoid activation function and batch normalization. Adam was used as the optimizer with learning rate=0.01 and using the amsgrad function.
